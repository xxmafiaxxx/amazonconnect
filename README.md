# amazonconnect
Basic webpage example of a custom Amazon Connect agent console. For more details:

included is the amazon connect code that we got mostly working

amazonconnect.html -page to work on- does not get info from database nor can you pull info. Is the API and lamda function working?

index.html - that is the file you sent me. Im not sure what this demonstrates.

original code.html - this is the functional demo from the amazon connect site.
